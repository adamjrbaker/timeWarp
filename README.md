## Overview

Time Warp is created to be as simple as possible for all animators to use, allowing them to quickly alter the speed of animation. With the control to alter single nodes over the default Maya time warp that alters the whole scene.

### UI
To launch the UI there are two options, from the menu or from a shelf button. If you choses to add a shelf button when using the Drag and Drop install method you will be presented with a new button on your Custom shelf.

```python 
from timeWarp.scripts import widget
widget.launch()
```
and the shelf icon can be found: `\timeWarp\icons\TimeWarpShelf.svg`

### Usage

#### Create
Creating a warp makes at WarpStatus node with the used defined name. This node will stay unevaluated until a node is added to the warp. Note this will create a warp the length of your timeline.

#### Adding To Warp
When you are ready selected the nodes you wish to add into this warp. You will see a new curve will appear. This will be your Warp Curve that your can manipulate to change the animation.

The bake warp option provides a simple and convent way to convert the adjusted animation back to world time. This tool will bake the effected nodes on one's within the current frame range. Post bake the tool with then delete the warp from existence. If you would like to bake out only a select number of nodes effected by the warp you will need to selected them and bake it out using Maya'ss Bake Simulation option.
